            <h1>Welcome to Path Of Life!</h1>
            <p>Where you will try to reach ULTIMATE life status among your peers.</p>
            <p>The goal of the game is to be the first one to max out your Happiness, Love, Health, 
                and reach $5000 in passive income!
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>How to play?</h1>
            <p>1.) To get started you must first roll the dice. Whichever number it lands on will 
                determine how your career begins!
            </p>
            <p>2.) Once everyone has rolled for how their careers will begin, Choose someone to go first.</p>
            <p>3.) Whoevers turn it's on will roll the dice and only the people has the rolled number as 
                one of their Chosen Numbers will be able to take part in the Activity if they choose to. 
            </p>
            <p>4.) Once everyone has gone once and it comes back to the first players turn, it will now
                be Payday. Paydays only occur on the first players turn. Every other turn however will be Payday 
                and Expense day. Expense day is that time of the month where you have to pay $600 for your 
                bills(can be paid off. Check Expenses).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>That is all there is to it! You continue to do this until someone wins the game!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Everytime you pay and go into debt, that payment is Multiplied by 2.</p>
            <br>
            <p>1 = <i>Part Time Wendy's Cashier.</i> $1000 paycheck. 3/6 Opportunity Cost</p>
            <p>2 = <i>Part Time Worker/Learner</i> = $500 paycheck. . 2/6 Opportunity Cost(at all levels)</p>

            <h1>What are Opportunity Costs, Activities, and Education Points?</h1>
            <p>Opportunity Cost:</p>
            <p>Opportunity Cost is what allows you to take part in Activities. Activities are 
                the events in which you gain Happiness, Love, and Health. Activities also allow
                you to take part in Wealth Opportunities that can bring you in a lot of money.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Activities occur every round but you're only allowed to take part in it if the Dice
                lands on one of your chosen numbers. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>You choose your chosen numbers from 1-6 depending on your Opportunity Cost.
                4/6 Opportunity Cost allows you to choose 4 numbers on the Dice to be the numbers
                that allow you to take part in Activities. (ex.4/6 allows you to choose 2,4,5,6(any numbers 1-6)).
                You can only change your chosen numbers whenever your Opportunity Cost changes. Opportunity
                Cost can change when you change careers. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Education Points:</p>
            <p>Education Points allow you to level up into different careers(max 4), unlock books, or level up your business. </p>
            <p>You gain an Education Point every paycheck and need a certain amount of
                points for different upgrades you want. Every upgrade in your career or business
                can be upgraded once more for the same amount of points. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Careers can only be upgraded 4 times max.</p>
            <p>Books can only be learned once.</p>
